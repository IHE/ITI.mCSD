# Yes this is an example CodeSystem
Reference to experimental CodeSystem https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD/CodeSystem/mcsd-example-hierarchy%

# understood that these IHE code systems are not published as a FHIR CodeSystem
A definition for CodeSystem 'urn:ihe:iti:xca:2010' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
A definition for CodeSystem 'urn:ihe:event-type-code' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
No definition could be found for URL value 'urn:ihe:event-type-code'
No definition could be found for URL value 'urn:ihe:iti:xca:2010'

# These come from BasicAudit and can be removed once that is updated.
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# This is a warning from a child profile where the slice doesn't exist in the parent profile so it is ok.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD/StructureDefinition/IHE.mCSD.Endpoint|4.0.1-current (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice) 

# These sliced values shouldn't be must support as they are optional (only at least one is required)
