A Data Source SHALL initiate a create request using HTTP POST as defined at [{{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create]({{site.data.fhir.path}}http.html#create) on the Care Services Resource. 

A Data Source SHALL submit the Care Services resource in either XML format or JSON format 
thus the media type of the HTTP body SHALL be either `application/fhir+json` or `application/fhir+xml` respectively.
A Directory SHALL accept both XML and JSON formats.

All References (Reference.reference element) to Resources defined in this transaction SHALL be populated with an resolvable URL (see [{{site.data.fhir.path}}references-definitions.html#Reference.reference]({{site.data.fhir.path}}references-definitions.html#Reference.reference)), unless the referenced resource is not available at a URL known to the server.

### 2:3.130.5 Security Considerations

Access controls should be considered to ensure only allowed users and/or systems are able to update data.  This may include resource or element level controls as well as Provenance for documenting the data source.  These access controls could be addressed by the client or the server as dictated by the implementation.  It is recommended to use [IUA](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/IUA/index.html) for authorization.

See [ITI TF-1: 46.5](volume-1.html#1465-mcsd-security-considerations) for security considerations for the mCSD Profile.

See [ITI TF-2: Appendix Z.8](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.8-mobile-security-considerations) for common mobile security considerations.

#### 2:3.130.5.1 Security Audit Considerations

Note that when grouped with ATNA Secure Node or Secure Application Actor, the same audit message is recorded by both Data Source and Directory. The
difference being the Audit Source element. Both sides record to show consistency
between the message sent by the Directory and the action taken at the Data Source.

When grouped with ATNA Secure Node or Secure Application actors, the actors involved shall be able to record audit events according to the transaction being used:

- [Audit Event for Care Services Feed by the Data Source and Directory for Create](StructureDefinition-IHE.mCSD.Audit.CareServices.Create.html)
- [Audit Event for Care Services Feed by the Data Source and Directory for Update](StructureDefinition-IHE.mCSD.Audit.CareServices.Update.html)
- [Audit Event for Care Services Feed by the Data Source and Directory for Delete](StructureDefinition-IHE.mCSD.Audit.CareServices.Delete.html).
- [Audit Event for Care Services Feed by the Data Source and Directory for Process](StructureDefinition-IHE.mCSD.Audit.CareServices.Process.html).

For a transaction Bundle, the actors shall also be able to record audit events for the individual entries in the Bundle.
