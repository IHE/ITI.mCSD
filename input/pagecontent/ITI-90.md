##### 2:3.90.4.2.3 Expected Actions

The Care Services Selective Consumer has received the response and continues with its workflow.

#### 2:3.90.4.3 Retrieve Care Services Resource message
This message represents an HTTP GET from the Care Services Selective Consumer to the Care Services Selective Supplier and provides a mechanism for retrieving a single Care Services Resource with a known resource identifier.

##### 2:3.90.4.3.1 Trigger Events
When the Care Services Selective Consumer possesses a Care Services Resource identifier (either through query, database lookup, or other mechanism) for which it requires additional or new information, it issues a Retrieve Care Services Resource interaction.

##### 2:3.90.4.3.2  Message Semantics
The Retrieve Care Services Resource is conducted by executing an HTTP GET against the Care Services Selective Supplier’s Care Services Resource URL, providing the resource id of the resource being retrieved. The target is formatted as:

```    GET [base]/[resource]/[resourceId]```

The Care Services Selective Supplier shall respond to this query by sending a single Care Services Resource instance.

The `resourceId` included in the request always represents the unique identifier for the Resource within the scope of the URL. For example, while `http://example1.org/ihe/Practitioner/1` and `http://example2.com/ihe/Practitioner/1` both contain the same `[resourceId]`, they reference two different resource instances.

Note: The use of "http" or "https" in URL does not override requirements to use TLS for security purposes.

##### 2:3.90.4.3.3 Expected Actions
The Care Services Selective Supplier shall retrieve the record indicated by the Resource identifier on the HTTP GET supplied by the Care Services Selective Consumer. The Care Services Selective Supplier shall respond to the retrieve request as described by the following cases:

**Case 1**: The Care Services Selective Supplier finds the care services record matching the `resourceId` sent in the HTTP request.

`HTTP 200` (OK) is returned as the HTTP status code.

A Care Services Resource is returned representing the result.

**Case 2**: The Care Services Selective Supplier fails to find the care services record matching the `resourceId` sent in the HTTP request.

`HTTP 404` (Not Found) is returned as the HTTP status code

An `OperationOutcome` Resource is returned indicating that the Care Services Resource could not be found, in an issue having:

Attribute|Value
---|---
severity|error
code|not-found
{:.grid}

The Care Services Selective Supplier may return other HTTP status codes to represent specific error conditions. When HTTP error status codes are returned by the Care Services Selective Supplier, they shall conform to the HTTP standard [RFC2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616). Their use is not further constrained or specified by this transaction.

#### 2:3.90.4.4 Retrieve Care Services Resource Response message

The Care Services Selective Supplier’s response to a successful Retrieve Care Services Resource message shall be an `HTTP 200` (OK) Status code with a Care Services Resource, or an appropriate error code.  See the [Retrieve Care Services Resource message expected actions](#2390433-expected-actions) for additional details.

##### 2:3.90.4.4.1 Trigger Events
The Care Services Selective Supplier found a record matching the Resource identifier specified by the Care Services Selective Consumer.

##### 2:3.90.4.4.2 Message Semantics
The Retrieve Care Services Resource response is sent from the Care Services Selective Supplier to the Care Services Selective Consumer as a single Care Services Resource. 

See [ITI TF-2: Appendix Z.6](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.6-populating-the-expected-response-format) for more details on response format handling. See [ITI TF-2: Appendix Z.7](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.7-guidance-on-access-denied-results) for guidance on Access Denied.

If the Care Services Selective Supplier is unable to produce a response in the requested format, it shall respond with an `HTTP 400` error indicating that it was unable to fulfill the request. The Care Services Selective Supplier may be capable of servicing requests for response formats not listed, but shall, at minimum, be capable of producing XML and JSON encodings.

###### 2:3.90.4.4.2.1 Care Services Resource Definition in the Context of Care Services Resource Response
The Care Services Resource definition in the context of a retrieve interaction is the FHIR definition of the various Care Services Resources. Table 2:3.90.4.4.2.1-1 lists the resources with where to find the additional constraints.

#### 2:3.90.5.1 Security Audit Considerations

Note that the same audit message is recorded by both Care Services Selective Supplier and Care Services Selective Consumer. The
difference being the Audit Source element. Both sides record to show consistency
between the message sent by the Consumer and the action taken at the Supplier.

The actors involved shall record audit events according to the
[Audit Event for Find Matching Care Services for Read by the Care Services Selective Supplier and Consumer](StructureDefinition-IHE.mCSD.Audit.CareServices.Read.html)
or the [Audit Event for Find Matching Care Services for Query by the Care Services Selective Supplier and Consumer](StructureDefinition-IHE.mCSD.Audit.CareServices.Query.html).
